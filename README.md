## ðŸ“Œ What does version control mean to me?

To me, version control is a system that helps developers track changes in their code, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. It provides a secure history of project development and makes teamwork easier by resolving conflicts and keeping work organized.
